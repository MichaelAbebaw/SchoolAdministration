# School Administration (Group Management)

The program is part of a school administration system, in group module. 

## Description

Students of a school are divided into classes, usually one or more per grade level.Each student studies a set of subjects, some common and some individual chosen. Students are then organized into groups where teachers hold lessons in those subjects. A group can contain more than one subject. In big schools with many students there can be multiple classes per grade level where as in smaller schools, a class might span over multiple grade levels.Groups may have both a minimum and a maximum number of students that are required or allowed. If the capacity of a group is reached or number of required students isnâ€™t reached, those student are unplaced.
